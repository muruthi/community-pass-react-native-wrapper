# Section: Pre-requisites

## 1.1. Before you Get Started

Ensure you have the following:

+ A desktop/laptop capable of running React Native for Android Development Environment. See specifications and instructions [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
+ A Community Pass Approved “Point of Interaction” (POI) device
+ A USB cable connecting the computer and device

## 1.2 Obtaining POI devices

### Community Pass Approved POI Devices

The following are the current Community Pass Approved Devices:

+ Samsung Active Tab Pro - SM-T540 (Wi-Fi only)
+ Samsung Active Tab Pro - SM-T547 (LTE)
+ Famoco FX 205 SE
+ Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3
+ Samsung A53 (SM-A536U1 model only)

Visit Samsung or Famoco or an authorized reseller within your locale to obtain approved POI devices.

Additional POI devices will be added to this list once they have completed the Mastercard certification process. For more information on the minimum CP device requirements, certification process, and to request that a specific device be added, please visit POI Service Overview.

**NOTE:** It may be possible for your team to test Community Pass Services using an unsupported device, but please note that these devices may not work with the Community Pass APIs as expected during the integration. The Community Pass team may aso not be able to provide any support for issues encountered when using unsupported devices.

#### Using an Unsupported Device

To use an unsupported device for development and testing purposes, provide the **Device Manufacturer**, **Brand**, **Model**, **Android Version**, and Kernel Version to `cp.partnerprogram [at] mastercard.com` via email.
We recommend using a utility such as Device Information specs (free app via Google Play Store) to get the exact values from the device itself.

## 1.3 Community Pass Test Cards

In this “getting started guide” only an Android device and development computer are required.

However, as you begin interacting with the Community Pass Platform API References, “Community Pass Test Cards with the Multi-Wallet Service Installed” will be required for much of the Community Pass functionality. It is recommended to obtain these devices at the same time as POI devices.

## 1.4 Community Pass SDK’s

You will also need access to the Community Pass SDK’s during the set-up phase.

For those already accepted into the “Community Pass Partnership Program” either directly through Mastercard or working with a CP incubator/accelerator partner, please request access to the required CP assets (AAR file) using the below link:

CP Assets Request

We will walk you through the steps required to obtain the Community Pass Kernel (CPK) in [Section 4](submit-app-details.md) of this guide

For questions/assistance obtaining Android devices and/or cards, please email CP Admin.
